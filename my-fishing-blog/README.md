Blog made in React

This is my first react project, which serves me to practice the knowledge I have acquired over frontend developer course and other tutorials like youtube, udemy and others in last few months

This version of my fishing blog is not a final one, styling and responsive design are missing and many thing that I must change, fix or add, but im still in start of my learning process, Ill keep working hard to learn more and apply it to the page
